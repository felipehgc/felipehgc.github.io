Since there are a lot of different parameter configurations, I've made it so you can just check all snapshots for [L = 80]({{ site.baseurl }}/placeholder1), [L = 90]({{ site.baseurl }}/placeholders/placeholder2), [L = 120]({{ site.baseurl }}/placeholders/placeholder3). Alternatively, you can also check all snapshots individually [here](https://github.com/felipehgc/felipehgc.github.io/tree/master/images/snapshots)
